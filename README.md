# Ultimate-AFK


# Features
- Detects AFK Players via in-game movement, camera movement
- Moves players to spectator after a determined AFK Time and grace period
- (Optional) Kick players from the server after repeated AFK detections!
- Custom broadcasts to AFK Players to indicate to them if they are AFK.
